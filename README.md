# Vola2-Unity

Brief project description.

## Game Idea
The game is based on a simple yet addictive concept of navigating through obstacles. The player has control over a flying character, and the goal is to successfully navigate through gaps between approaching obstacles. This concept was inspired by the popular game "Flappy Bird".

## Game Proposal
The proposal for this game is to provide a gameplay experience that is easy to understand but challenging to master. It requires quick reflexes, precision, and patience from the player. The increasing score and the possibility of beating the high score serve as strong incentives to keep playing.
